# Experimenting with the Arrow SoCKit

I recently acquired one of the new [Arrow SoCKits](http://www.arrownac.com/solutions/sockit/),
which are development boards for Altera's Cyclone V ARM processor / FPGA SoCs.
This repository holds some code and hardware descriptions testing various
features of the board.
